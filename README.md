# Workout_Tracker

## Mock-Up
This application is a workout tracker that uses a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema that handles routes with Express.

User Story:

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

When the user loads the page, they are given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout. The user can add exercises to the most recent workout plan, add new exercises to a new workout plan, view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the stats page, view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the stats page.
