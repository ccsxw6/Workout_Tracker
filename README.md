## Mock-Up
Burger-Logger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

This application is deployed on Heroku and uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.
